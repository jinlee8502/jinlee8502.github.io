<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Hello! What did you think about last week's lab? We understand that we didn't explain some of the very important things well, so this week, we will make sure that all the directions are clear and make sense. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">To start off LAB2, we will actually do some drawing for the first time with the tool "Turtle Graphics". First, download "hexagon_student.py" from <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/sh/tng1xln1kmz97j1/AAAqXLTDoFIJ84_NCIkNfJ_Ra?dl=1">here</a>.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">After doing so, a zip file will appear in your downloads folder in the lower right corner. Clicking the zip file will unzip the file and produce a file called "hexagon_student.py". Now, simply drag this file to Desktop(where the desktop picture of your animal is).</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Now that the file is on your Desktop, open Sublime on the dock (where the icons are on the bottom of your screen) and go to FILE(on the very top) and OPEN and find DESKTOP on the left side of the pop-up window. Click on the "hexagon_student.py" file and OPEN.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Locate the instruction, "YOUR CODE STARTS HERE". Note that you only have to edit the lines 15, 16, and 17 of this file. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Think about how to tell the computer how to draw a hexagon. How many sides does it have? What are some of the angles that the sides make with each other? </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Some technicalities: "t" stands for "turtle". Calling "t.forward()" will make the turtle go forward by however much you specify within the parenthesis with a number. Calling "t.right()" will make turtle turn right by however many degrees you specify within the parenthesis with a number.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Look at line 10, "while SIDE is less than or equal to 6". This declaration starts something called a loop. A loop repeats all the actions in its "suite"(lines 11-19 with an indent) as long as the condition(SIDE is less than or equal to 6) is met. Note how on line 8, SIDE starts at 1. This means that if we add 1 to SIDE every time we execute the suite, we will have gone through the loop total 6 times by the end.  </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Therefore, the suite will look some thing like this. Move the turtle forward by LENGTH. Turn the turtle by a certain number of degrees. And finally set side to one more than what it used to be. The rest will get taken by the loop, repeating the same process 6 times to draw a hexagon.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">After making some changes, test your code by running the command "python3 hexagon_student.py" on the Terminal. Ask for help from one of us for this step. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Did a black window pop up and did a "turtle" start drawing hexagons for you? (give it a few seconds for the colors to get darker) Awesome! Just enjoy for a few seconds the beauty of drawing with a computer. If not, did you get a bunch of error messages? Then, you should go back and try to fix your code. Don't hesitate to ask for help! </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">The rest of the lab will be trying to finish last week's lab. Make sure your lab01.py is on the Desktop and that you open it using Sublime. Again, ask us for help when using Terminal. </span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">NOTE: ALWAYS make sure you save all your work on both Sublime and TextEdit. You can do this by doing "COMMAND + S"(press the command button next to the space bar and the letter s at the same time). Or by clicking FILE on the menu bar and SAVE. I believe there were a couple who forgot to save their work last week and some of that work is forever lost...It's ok. Call us for help! </span></p>

<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Before getting into actual logic and tools, let’s make sure some of our math is taken care of.</span></p>
<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Basically, the first division does what it’s supposed to. The second one however gets rid of the decimals.</span></p>

<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">A conditional statement in Python consists of a series of headers and suites: a required if clause, an optional sequence of elif clauses, and finally an optional else clause:</span></p>

else:
...... "suite"

<p class="Body"><span style="font-size:12pt;font-family:'Andale Mono';">Let's go through this function together! A variable named "number" is now 1. A variable named "total" is now 0.

whlie "expression":
